	    <h2>CPSC 1030: Web Development I</h2>
	    <p>Students will examine the structure of the internet and the World Wide Web and how they work; design and implement professional interactive websites using styles in CSS. Topics include design principles, image manipulation, and simple CGI scripting. Explore innovative trends that use the internet as a computing platform.</p>
        </article>

        <article tabindex="0">
	    <h2>CPSC 1050: Introduction to Computer Science</h2>
	    <p>Offers a broad overview of the computer science discipline. Provides students with an appreciation for and an understanding of the many different aspects of the discipline. Topics include information and data representation; introduction to computer hardware and programming; networks; applications (e.g. spreadsheet, database); social networking; ethics; and history. Intended for both students expecting to continue in computer science as well as for those taking it for general interest.</p>
        </article>

        <article tabindex="0">
	    <h2>CPSC 1150: Program Design</h2>
	    <p>Program design entails building and implementing an algorithm in a programming language (such as Java) using good software development principles. Students develop problem-solving techniques while learning the basics of algorithm development, procedural abstraction, and data representation.</p>
        </article>

        <article tabindex="0">
	    <h2>CPSC 1160: Algorithms and Data Structures I</h2>
	    <p>Students focus on practicing and developing programing skills. Students implement algorithms along with appropriate data structures to produce good software. Students apply recursion, abstract data types, algorithm analysis, sorting and searching algorithms, pointers, arrays, dynamic memory management, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Students also learn about low-level data representations and systematic software development. As a tool, object-oriented programming is introduced.</p>
        </article>

        <article tabindex="0">
	    <h2>CPSC 1181: Object-oriented Computing</h2>
	    <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm to design and develop software based on the concept of objects. Students are introduced to the fundamental concepts of programming from an object-oriented (OO) perspective: abstraction; objects; classes and class hierarchies; methods; encapsulation and information hiding; inheritance; polymorphism. Students learn and practice the application of OO design with modeling tools (e.g. class diagrams), container/collection classes, event-driven programming, exception handling, GUI, multi-threading, and networking. The focus is placed on good software engineering principles using a language that supports the OO paradigm.</p>
        </article>

        <article tabindex="0">
	    <h2>CPSC 1280: Unix Tools and Scripting</h2>
	    <p>Introduction to concepts and practices in operating systems, software engineering tools, system and network administration. Scripting languages, utilities, tools and techniques. Topics include command line interface, filters, pipelines, file organization, reusable utilities, software configuration management, simplifying programming tasks, System/Network configuration, administration, and security issues.</p>
        </article>

        <article tabindex="0">
	    <h2>CPSC 2030: Web Development II</h2>
	    <p>Intermediate website design and development covering information architecture, accessibility and usability. Includes advanced CSS, basic programming (client-side and server-side scripting), the Document Object Model (DOM), handling form data and designing for mobile devices. Students will design and implement a moderately complex website as a class project.</p>
        </article>

        <article tabindex="0">
	    <h2>CPSC 2150: Algorithms and Data Structures II</h2>
	    <p>Students build on the foundational concepts learned in CPSC 1160 and expand their skills to include non-linear data structures and hashing. Topics include algorithm analysis, non-comparative sorting, algorithmic paradigms (divide and conquer, greedy, heuristic, backtracking, and dynamic programming), binary search trees, balanced trees, tree traversals, priority queues and heaps, Huffman codes, graphs, and graph algorithms. Students implement solutions using an object-oriented programming language.</p>
        </article>

        <article tabindex="0">
	    <h2>CPSC 2190: Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science</h2>
	    <p>Covers sets and propositions; relations and functions; permutations, combinations and counting; induction proofs; graphs, trees and networks; Boolean algebra and mathematical models; application of theoretical concepts to program development.</p>
